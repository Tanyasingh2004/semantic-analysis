Semantic Analysis Project

Semantic Analysis is the process of understanding the meaning and context of text beyond just keywords. This project focuses on extracting, analyzing, and interpreting semantic relationships from textual data using NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques.

🚀 Features

Text preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization

Word embeddings with Word2Vec / GloVe / BERT

Semantic similarity calculation between words, sentences, or documents

Visualization of semantic clusters using t-SNE / PCA

Applications in sentiment analysis, document clustering, and chatbot intent understanding
